# LeavodaTest - React Login Dashboard

This project is a simple login + dashboard web app built for a technical assignment.

Users can log in using only a **username**, and upon successful login, their full profile details are displayed on a dashboard — all data is fetched from the [DummyJSON API](https://dummyjson.com/).

## ✨ Features

- 🧑‍💼 **Dashboard** — displays:

  - Address (full)
  - Company (name, department, title)

- 📦 **State management** with Redux Toolkit
- 🎨 **UI components** with [Material-UI (MUI)](https://mui.com/)

Styling is kept clean and minimal for readability and UX clarity.

SCSS was not used, since styling with MUI was sufficient and SCSS was optional.
